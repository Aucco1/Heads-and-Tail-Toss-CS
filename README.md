## Conclusion
### The visualizations presented gives a direct look at the Law of Large Numbers. By graphing frequencies over hundreds of attempts, it shows how short-term randomness eventually settles into a stable 50/50 probability. Using both Table and Tiles surfaces also lets us see if the physical environment actually messes with the "fairness" of the toss or if the math holds up regardless of the floor, in which case there is NO difference and is irrelevant.
